## TocParameters.anchored property

Whether to insert an anchor element to each matching DOM element, and potentially a paragraph element for "scroll padding". Defaults to `96`

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
anchored: number | boolean;
```

## Remarks

The action will insert an anchor element as a child of each matching DOM element for navigation purposes.

If you click on an anchor tag that references an internal element (attribute id = "\#some-element"), the browser should do an equivalence of setting the `window.scrollY` to `offsetTop` of the element. Often, however, this is not what user expects, because some fixed content such as a navbar will cover up some of the content of element.

`toc` solves this by also adding an `absolute`<!-- -->,`hidden` paragraph relative to the matching DOM element, besides the mentioned anchor element, The `id` attribute holder is delegated to this paragraph. If anchored is provided as a number, it will be the height of said paragraph, effectively creating a "scroll padding".

Say for example, your navbar is 80px in height, you'll want to set `anchored` to a number &gt;<!-- -->= 80.

If `anchored` is nonpositive, no paragraph will be inserted.

If `anchored` is `false`<!-- -->, no paragraph or anchor will be inserted.
